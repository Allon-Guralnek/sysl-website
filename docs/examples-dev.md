## As a Developer

As a developer, you've gotten over the initial excitement of building REST/gRPC applications and you find your job becoming repetitive, every task seems to be to expose this endpoint, or wire this frontend application to this service. Your time is spent between writing boilerplate code and constantly trying to keep documentation up to date. What if it didn't have to be this way?

Sysl can let you reclaim your time by generating your boilerplate code, as well as your documentation so that you can focus on what you like doing most: building awesome applications!
