## What is Sysl?

[Sysl](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl) is an open-sourced system specification language designed for modelling distributed web applications. A Sysl specification captures the design of your project—or your entire organisation—and becomes a single source of truth.

Sysl supports an ecosystem of tools that generate all kinds of artifacts, including:

* API documentation
* Design diagrams: data, integration and sequence
* SQL scripts: create and migrate databases
* Boilerplate code: client/server REST/gRPC in Go

Sysl saves time, allows you to focus on your core business logic, and guarantees that the design and implementation stay in sync.

## Get started

Check out [Installation](installation.md) for how to install Sysl. Or just grab a pre-compiled binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/releases).

To write Sysl specifications, you'll want [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Sysl extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ANZ-BANK.vscode-sysl) for syntax highlighting `.sysl` files.

Once you have `sysl` working, **[start with the Tutorial](tutorial.md)** to get a feel for what Sysl can do.

There are also use cases for [developers](examples-dev.md) and [non-developers](examples-non-dev.md), and more in-depth details of the [each of Sysl's features](features.md) and the [language itself](lang-spec.md).
