Sysl can generate server and client code. Currently, Go is the only language supported, but we have several on the roadmap including (Swift, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin). If you have a language you'd like to see supported, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md), so we can better prioritise it.

<!-- To get started with generating code with sysl, refer to [code-generation](/docs/byexample/code-generation/) -->
