## Is Sysl the right tool for me?
Sysl (pronounced “sizzle”) provides an improvement over many current system design and architecture practices. If you are struggling to keep all of your design, implementation and testing work in sync, then the answer may be yes.

Sysl can create diagrams, data schemas, code (Go) and data transformations. The set of outputs is open-ended and allows for your own extensions.
