In this tutorial, we're going to create a simple Sysl specification (i.e. a `.sysl` file), and use the `sysl` command line tool to generate a variety of outputs. We will touch briefly of many of features of Sysl, and link to in-depth guides where you can learn more.
 

## Hello World

Sysl specifications appear similar to [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), with nested blocks of text organised with colons and indentation. However Sysl specifications are not just raw data: each block models a particular concept determined by its level and type.

Let's start with a simple example: modelling a greeting system that will authenticate the user to get their name, and then display a personalised greeting. By the end we'll be generating diagrams like this:

## Applications

Create a new file called `hello.sysl` with the following content:

```sysl
HelloService:
    ...
```

This is an empty model of an **application** called `HelloService`. An application is a component of a system, for example a web service, mobile app, or database.

The first line here consists of an application name followed by a colon to start an indented block, which will specify the named application.

The `...` on the second line is a **placeholder**. You can use placeholders when you don't yet have some details of the specification. Sysl specifications are living documents that evolve alongside the systems as they're designed and built.

This is already a valid Sysl specification. We can't generate anything interesting from it, but we can see that `sysl` is able to parse it and output the information as a **protobuf** for other tools to use:

```bash
$ sysl protobuf --mode=json hello.sysl
{
 "apps":  {
  "HelloService":  {
   "name":  {
    "part":  [
     "HelloService"
    ]
   },
   "endpoints":  {
    "...":  {
     "name":  "..."
    }
   },
   [...]
}
```

See [Exporting Sysl](cmd-export.md) for more about outputting Sysl protobufs.

## Endpoints

`HelloService` is a web service that returns the user's greeting. In Sysl, applications are modelled as a collection of **endpoints**, so we'll add a new greeting endpoint below `HelloService:`:

```sysl
# The fantastic Hello World greeting system.

HelloService:
    /greeting/{userId}:
        GET:
            ...
```

A few things are happening here:

`#` begins a comment. The first line is just describing the system represented by the specification (this is of course optional).

`/greeting/{userId <: int}` is the path of the endpoint. Using a path indicates that this endpoint is a REST endpoint; RPC endpoints can also be specified with a function signature (e.g. `GetGreeting(userIduserId <: int)`).

`{userId <: int}` describes a path **parameter** of **type** integer. Whatever value is provided when calling the endpoint will be interpreted as an integer, and bound to the name `userId`.

:::info
The `<:` is the "set element" operator. `x <: Y` asserts that `x` is in the set `Y`. Sysl uses it for specifying the type of a variable. In this case, it reads as "`userId` is an integer" (i.e. "`userId` is in the set of all integers")".
:::

The `GET` in the block beneath the path indicates the HTTP method of the endpoint. This is the end of the endpoint declaration. In sum, we've specified that "`HelloService` exposes a REST endpoint `GET /greeting/{userId <: int}`".

The block following the endpoint declaration models its **behaviour**. We've once again used the placeholder `...` to indicate that we don't have a detailed specification for it yet.

So far all we've specified is names, so we still can't generate anything of much use. But we're making progress! In the meantime, we can **validate** that the specification is still valid:

```bash
$ sysl validate hello.sysl
```

`validate` displays no output if the input is valid.

## Communication

Let's introduce another application so that we can model some communication. The user is going to receive their greeting via a mobile app called `Hello App` (yes, spaces are okay), which will fetch the greeting to display from `HelloService`.

As mentioned above, Sysl generally models components as "applications with endpoints". A natural interpretation for user-facing applications is that the *app* is an application, and *each screen* (or *task*) within the app is an endpoint.

You can probably guess what happens next:

```sysl
# The fantastic Hello World greeting system.

HelloService:
    /greeting/{userId <: int}:
        GET:
            ...

Hello App:
    Greet:
        HelloService <- GET /greeting/{userId}
```

We've added a new `Hello App` application with a `Greet` endpoint, and specified its behaviour. The behaviour says that `Greet` does one thing: it sends a request to `HelloService`, invoking the `GET /greeting/{userId}` endpoint (the `app <- endpoint` operator can be read like "`app` receives call to `endpoint`").

:::note
At this level of detail, we're not interested in specifically what happens to the result of the call. However Sysl has a special grammar for specifying more detailed behaviour as transformations.
:::

Now that our system has some communication happening, we can generate some useful output. **Diagrams** are the most common representation of Sysl specifications, since they are visual, rich, standard, and easily shared.

Let's create a **sequence diagram** illustrating the communication. Sequence diagram generation requires an interaction (i.e. an endpoint invocation) to draw, so we'll use `Hello App <- Greet` 

```bash
sysl sd --endpoint="Hello App <- Greet" hello.sysl
```

This produces the diagram below:

![Sequence diagram of the Greet endpoint](../examples/tutorial/out/3_hello_communication_sd.png)

This shows `Hello App` sending a `GET /greeting/{userId}` request to `HelloService`. Great!

However it's a bit clunky to have to spell out the full endpoint name for every diagram that we want to generate. Sure, you could write a script with multiple calls, but that would grow stale as the spec evolves. To keep it all in the Sysl universe, we have the concept of a **project**.


## Projects

Sysl is designed to be used by project teams within the context of a larger organisation. These teams must generate certain documentation relating to a subset of the applications in the system.

Sysl has a concept of a **project** that represents a view, a particular subset of a Sysl model for which to generate outputs.

Let's demonstrate by creating a project that captures the whole system:

```sysl
# The fantastic Hello World greeting system.

HelloService:
    /greeting/{userId <: int}:
        GET:
            ...

Hello App:
    Greet:
        HelloService <- GET /greeting/{userId}

HelloProject:
    Greeting:
        Hello App
        HelloService
        Hello App <- Greet
```

Notice that the structure is similar to that of an application: three nested blocks. Indeed, generating a diagram of the whole module will treat `HelloProject` as an application, because there's nothing special about it.

However when invoking `sysl` to generate diagrams, we can provide `HelloProject` as the `project` parameter. Then the inner-most block is interpreted as a list of applications and endpoints of interest. The resulting diagram will contain only those (and not a box for `HelloProject`).

Let's take a look:

```bash
sysl sd --app HelloProject hello.sysl
```

![Sequence diagram of the Greeting scenario](../examples/tutorial/out/4_hello_project_sd.png)

```bash
sysl ints --project HelloProject hello.sysl
```

![Integration diagram of the Greeting scenario](../examples/tutorial/out/4_hello_project_ints.png)

```bash
sysl ints --epa --project HelloProject hello.sysl
```

![Endpoint analysis diagram of the Greeting scenario](../examples/tutorial/out/4_hello_project_epa.png)

Now we're getting somewhere! These diagrams are pretty basic, but they will grow with the Sysl model. You can also customise them with additional model attributes and command line flags. See [Diagram Generation](gen-diagram.md) for more details.

## Next steps

This is just scratching the surface of what Sysl can do, but hopefully you're starting to see how it can be used to support and maintain the design, implementation and testing of an application, and of the whole enterprise.

To learn more about how Sysl can support you in your role, take a deeper dive in the following guides:
